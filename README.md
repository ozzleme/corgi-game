# Ironhack | Project 1
## This is a project I made after completing module 1 in the Ironhack Web Developer Part Time Course. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a game in which a corgi character dodges obstacles and collects dog bones for points. The game is inspired by my grandparents and their own corgi, Dottie.
